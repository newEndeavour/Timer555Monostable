sentence=The Timer555Monostable library is a element in the design of capacitive sensors that can detect touch or proximity by measuring Capacitance using the 555 Timer in Monostable Mode. 
paragraph=The Capacitance (or self capacitance) of a Sensor (eg a piece of foil) connected to the circuit as C1, changes when in proximity or contact with the human body/object. By reading the capacitance continuously, one is able to determine if an object has been approached (high value of R1) or indeed touched (lower value of R1). The sensor setup requires a medium to high value resistor as R1. The advantage of using a 555 Timer over a single RC circuit (two Pins and one resistor) is the ability to actually measure the (self-)capacitance level (or its variation), in a reliable way without exposing the Arduino board to undue stress from static electricity. The monostable mode makes it easy to use in any Arduino sketch/project as one retains control over the timing of the measurements (compared to, eg. the Astable mode which oscillates constinuously).
